## 🚀 How to Compile

To compile the project locally:

1. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as **TeX Live** or **MiKTeX**.
2. Open the `Cartesian Lines Formulas.tex` file in your preferred LaTeX editor (TeXstudio, Overleaf, etc.).
3. Compile using `pdflatex` or an equivalent LaTeX compiler to generate the updated PDF.

**Tip:** If using Overleaf, simply open the `.tex` file and click **Recompile** — no local setup required.
