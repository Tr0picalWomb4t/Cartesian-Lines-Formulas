# 📐 Cartesian Lines Formulas

Formulas for lines in the Cartesian plane — a **LaTeX** project collecting mathematical formulas and representations for lines in the Cartesian plane.  
The project was created and maintained using **Overleaf**, making it easy to edit, compile, and collaborate online.

This repository contains a LaTeX document with the main equations, formulas, and properties of lines in the Cartesian plane, useful as a reference or educational material.

## 📦 Repository Contents

The project includes:

- `Cartesian Lines Formulas.tex` — main LaTeX source containing all formulas.
- `Cartesian Lines Formulas.pdf` — compiled version of the document (PDF).

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find in the Document

The LaTeX document covers key analytic geometry concepts related to lines in the Cartesian plane, including:

- Line equations (slope-intercept, standard form, etc.)
- Slope and geometric interpretation
- Intersection points
- Relative positions of lines (parallel, coincident, perpendicular)
- Applications and example formulas

## 🚀 How to Compile

To compile the project locally:

1. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as **TeX Live** or **MiKTeX**.
2. Open the `Cartesian Lines Formulas.tex` file in your preferred LaTeX editor (TeXstudio, Overleaf, etc.).
3. Compile using `pdflatex` or an equivalent LaTeX compiler to generate the updated PDF.

**Tip:** If using Overleaf, simply open the `.tex` file and click **Recompile** — no local setup required.
